//! HRPD forward-link symbol scrambler (C.S0024-200-C §1.4.1.3.2.3.3).
//!
//! The forward-traffic scrambler is a 17-bit Fibonacci LFSR with
//! characteristic polynomial h(D) = D^17 + D^14 + 1. At the start of each
//! physical-layer packet the register is loaded with
//! `[1 1 1 1 1 1 1  r5 r4 r3 r2 r1 r0  d3 d2 d1 d0]`,
//! where `r5..r0` are the 6-bit preamble MACIndex (§1.4.1.3.2.1.3) and
//! `d3..d0` encode the data rate / packet size (Table 1.4.1.3.2.3.3-1).
//! The loaded initial state itself yields the first scrambling bit; the
//! register is then clocked once per encoder output symbol.
//!
//! Convention used here: state bit 16 is the leftmost bit in the spec
//! figure and state bit 0 is the rightmost bit (`d0`). The scrambling
//! sequence is tapped from the leftmost bit. After emitting that bit,
//! feedback `bit16 XOR bit13` is shifted into bit 0 and the rest of the
//! state shifts toward bit 16.
//!
//! C.S0024-200-C also defines a structurally identical reverse-link
//! scrambler (§2.3.1.3.5) whose initial-state load differs: the MACIndex
//! field is replaced by eleven leading `1`s plus the 2-bit reverse-link
//! interlace-offset value `i1 i0`. That seeding is exposed via
//! [`HrpdForwardScrambler::with_initial_state`] but the per-packet helper
//! here covers the forward path only.
